## 📌 Overview
This project is focused on predicting multiple diseases using machine learning techniques. The model takes input features related to patient health and predicts the likelihood of different diseases.

## 🚀 Features
- Supports multiple disease predictions.
- Uses machine learning algorithms for classification.
- User-friendly interface for input data submission.
- Provides accurate and real-time predictions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Streamlit (for web-based UI)
- Flask/Django (if applicable for API deployment)

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of medical records with various features such as blood pressure, sugar levels, and other health indicators. Ensure that the dataset is placed in the `dataset/` directory before training.

## 🏗️ Model Training
To train the model, use the following command:
```bash
python train.py
```
This will train the machine learning model and save it in the `models/` directory.
